Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the
above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

See the following in which the result is broken down. Please, use the Query 4) to get the expected result.

// Query 1) Join the two tables by employee DepartmentId and department Id
    SELECT d.Name as DEPARTMENT, e.Name as EMPLOYEE, e.Salary
    FROM Employee as e
    JOIN Department as d
    ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id;

// Query 2) Join the two tables by employee DepartmentId and department Id ordered by Salary.
    SELECT d.Name as DEPARTMENT, e.Name as EMPLOYEE, e.Salary
    FROM Employee as e
    JOIN Department as d
    ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
    ORDER BY e.Salary DESC;

// Query 3) Sort by Salary Rank in each DepartmentId. The Instructions indicates that the order does not matter, but it is still required here in order for the DENSE_RANK to work as expected
    SELECT d.Name as DEPARTMENT, e.Name as EMPLOYEE, e.Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.Name ORDER BY e.Salary DESC ) as RNK
    FROM Employee as e
    JOIN Department as d
    ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id


// Query 4) Select only the top 3 Salary in each DepartmentId
SELECT DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE, SALARY
FROM (
    SELECT d.Name as DEPARTMENT, e.Name as EMPLOYEE, e.Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.Name ORDER BY e.Salary DESC ) as RNK
    FROM Employee as e
    JOIN Department as d
    ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
) t
WHERE RNK <= 3;
